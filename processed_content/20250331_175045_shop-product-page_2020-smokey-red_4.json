  "chunk_text": "These grapes were harvested during the Santiam Canyon Wildfires of 2020 which have left their subtle mark on this Wine. Notes of cherry-cola, white pepper, and just a hint of smoke combine with a pleasant acidity that allows this wine to pair with just about anything. To help our local communities recover from the fires, we are donating $5 from every bottle sold to the SCWRF. 12.9% ALC/VOL \nSOLD OUT\n[All wines are currently available  \nfor in-person sales only.",

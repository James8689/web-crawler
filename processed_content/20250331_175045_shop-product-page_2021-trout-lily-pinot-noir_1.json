Expect lifted floral notes of lavender & violet on the nose. On the palette, this 100% Old Vine Pinot produces flavors of plum and black raspberries accompanied by hints of cranberry. This well-structured wine was built to age. Expect to enjoy this Pinot Noir well into 2029. Limited run, only 47 cases produced.",

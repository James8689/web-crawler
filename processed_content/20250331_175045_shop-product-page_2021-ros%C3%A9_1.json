  "chunk_text": "Skip to Main Content\n## Bright, Beautiful & Refreshing\nSourced from a small vineyard in Yamhill-Carlton. 100% Pommard clone, direct pressed and fermented in stainless steel. This wine has a very pale salmon color and aromas of citrus blossom, jasmine, tarragon and basil. On the palate, flavors of ripe ruby-red grapefruit, pomelo, watermelon, pie cherry, and hibiscus. Thus elegant wine is completely dry with bright acidity and freshness.",

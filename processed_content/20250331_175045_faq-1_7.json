We are simply here to make sure everything goes according to plan at the venue. #### Does the venue rental come with an onsite manager for the event date? YES! At a minimum, you must have a **Day of Coordinator** to ensure\nthat all plans are thought out and executed to the best of our ability. WHV can provide this service for an additional fee. If you do not have a coordinator within 3 months of the wedding WHV will add this service.",

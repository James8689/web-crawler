  "chunk_text": "#### Is gratuity included? Most wineries are open from 11:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Some open at 10:00 AM and a few stay open until 8:00 PM. #### How late are the wineries open? It's best to have wine shipped from where it was purchased. If West Hills' wine is purchased, we can ship to many (not all) states. #### Can West Hills ship any wine I might purchase on the tour? While we love furry friends, they are not allowed in the van unless they are trained service dogs.",

  "chunk_text": "#### I hear there are dog-friendly wineries. Can my dog come along on the tour? Yes, but one of the advantages of having a great tasting room chef is that we can offer one-of-a-kind gourmet food on our tours. #### Can we bring our own food? We can accommodate up to 14 guests in our large Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van and up to 5 in our small Mercedes-Benz Metris van. Our Classic Cars can accommodate two guests. #### How many people can you accomodate?",
